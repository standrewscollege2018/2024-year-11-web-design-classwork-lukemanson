        <h1>The United Kingdom</h1>

        <!-- Introduction -->
         <div class="introduction">
            <p>Living just north of London was perfect, as we were close enough to train into London for the day, but also had easy access to the M1 and M25.</p>
            <p>We could easily drive anywhere, and also had a train line passing directly through the town.</p>
            <p>We tried to travel every weekend, and some of our highlights are below:</p>

        <div class="container">

            <div class="card">
                <!-- St. Alban's Cathedral -->
                <img src="images/stalbanscathedral.jpg" alt="St Alban's Cathedral">
                <h2>St Alban's Cathedral</h2>
                <p>This was our local cathedral, and is the site of the longest continuing Christian worship in the UK.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <!-- Tower Bridge -->
                <img src="images/towerbridge.jpg" alt="Tower Bridge">
                <h2>Tower Bridge, London</h2>
                <p>This iconic old bridge is located right next to the Tower of London. We climbed across the top and were directly above the bridge when it opened up to allow boats through on the Queen's jubilee.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <!-- Stonehenge -->
                <img src="images/stonehenge.jpg" alt="Stonehenge">
                <h2>Stonehenge</h2>
                <p>This ancient stone circle stands alone on the wide Salisbury plains. It was below freezing on the day we visited!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <!-- St Andrew's -->
                <img src="images/standrews.jpg" alt="St Andrew's">
                <h2>St Andrew's</h2>
                <p>A must for all StAC students and staff visiting Scotland! The ruins are beautiful, and we visited on a rare sunny and mild day.</p>

                <h2>Lord's Cricket Ground</h2>
                <p>As a serious sports fan, visiting the home of cricket was truly memorable. Although the cold rain all morning was not ideal for cricket.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <!-- Bletchley Park -->
